# Traditional Machine Learning Approach

This document explains why we chose traditional ML models over deep learning for this blockchain analysis system.

## Why Traditional ML?

### 1. **Interpretability**
- **Traditional ML**: Models like Random Forest, XGBoost provide clear feature importance
- **Deep Learning**: Black-box models that are difficult to interpret
- **Benefit**: Financial applications require explainable decisions

### 2. **Data Requirements**
- **Traditional ML**: Works well with smaller datasets (thousands to tens of thousands of samples)
- **Deep Learning**: Requires large datasets (millions of samples) for optimal performance
- **Benefit**: Blockchain transaction data may not always be massive

### 3. **Computational Efficiency**
- **Traditional ML**: Fast training and inference, suitable for real-time applications
- **Deep Learning**: Computationally intensive, requires GPUs for optimal performance
- **Benefit**: Real-time blockchain monitoring needs fast response times

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
- **Traditional ML**: Leverages domain expertise through feature engineering
- **Deep Learning**: Often relies on raw data representation
- **Benefit**: Blockchain domain knowledge can be encoded in features

## Selected Models

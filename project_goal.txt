✅ Fully Achievable Goals:

1. Real-time alerts
    - How: Subscribe to "unconfirmed_sub" and "addr_sub"
    - Implementation: Filter transactions by value, then trigger Telegram/email
    - Example: Monitor for transactions > 10 BTC and send alerts

2. Whale tracker
    - How: Use "unconfirmed_sub" to catch large transactions early
    - Implementation: Filter x.out[].value for amounts > threshold
    - Perfect for: Tracking large movements before confirmation

3. Real-time crypto dashboards
    - How: Combine "blocks_sub" + "unconfirmed_sub" + "addr_sub"
    - Data available: Transaction volumes, block times, address flows
    - Tech stack: Streamlit/Dash + WebSocket connection

4. Live blockchain explorers
    - How: Use all subscription types
    - Data: Full transaction details, block info, address monitoring
    - Features: Real-time transaction tracking, address history

5. Save data
    - How: Process WebSocket messages and store in database
    - Options: SQLite (simple), PostgreSQL (scalable), MongoDB (flexible)
    - Use case: Historical analysis, pattern detection

6. Blockchain-based anomaly detection (ML models)
    - How: Collect transaction data over time, extract features
    - Features: Transaction size, frequency, address patterns, timing
    - Implementation: Train models on historical data, apply to real-time stream

7. Transaction monitoring for fintech/exchanges
    - How: Use "addr_sub" to monitor specific exchange addresses
    - Use cases:
        - Monitor exchange hot wallets
        - Track large deposits/withdrawals
        - Detect unusual activity patterns

8. Push notification bots
    - How: Process WebSocket data and integrate with Telegram/Slack APIs
    - Triggers: Large transactions, specific address activity, unusual patterns


Data You'll Have Access To:
    - Transaction details: Amounts, addresses, timestamps, fees
    - Block information: Height, hash, mining difficulty, reward
    - Address activity: Real-time monitoring of specific addresses
    - Network metrics: Transaction volume, block times
